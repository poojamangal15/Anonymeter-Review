    "# Anonymeter Vehicle coupon recommendation notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the usage of `Anonymeter` on vehicle coupon recommendation dataset, a software to derive GDPR-aligned measures of the privacy of synthetic datasets in an empirical, attack based fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Anonymeter` contains privacy evaluators which measures the risks of singling out, linkability, and inference which might incur to data donors following the release of synthetic dataset. These risk are the three key indicators of factual anonymization according to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For more details, please refer to [M. Giomi et al. 2022](https://petsymposium.org/popets/2023/popets-2023-0055.php)."

    "### Basic usage pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these privacy risks anonymeter provide an `Evaluator` class. The high-level classes `SinglingOutEvaluator`, `LinkabilityEvaluator`, and `InferenceEvaluator` are the only thing that you need to import from `Anonymeter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the different nature of the privacy risks they evaluate, these classes have the same interface and are used in the same way. To instantiate the evaluator you have to provide three dataframes: the original dataset `ori` which has been used to generate the synthetic data, the synthetic data `syn`, and a `control` dataset containing original records which have not been used to generate the synthetic data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another parameter common to all evaluators is the number of target records to attack (`n_attacks`). A higher number will reduce the statistical uncertainties on the results, at the expense of a longer computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "evaluator = *Evaluator(ori: pd.DataFrame, \n",
    "                       syn: pd.DataFrame, \n",
    "                       control: pd.DataFrame,\n",
    "                       n_attacks: int)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once instantiated the evaluation pipeline is executed when calling the `evaluate`, and the resulting estimate of the risk can be accessed using the `risk()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "evaluator.evaluate()\n",
    "risk = evaluator.risk()\n",

    "### A peak under the hood\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Anonymeter` each privacy risk is derived from a privacy attacker whose task is to use the synthetic dataset to come up with a set of *guesses* of the form:\n",
    "- \"there is only one person with attributes X, Y, and Z\" (singling out)\n",
    "- \"records A and B belong to the same person\" (linkability)\n",
    "- \"a person with attributes X and Y also have Z\" (inference)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each evaluation consists of running three different attacks:\n",
    "- the \"main\" privacy attack, in which the attacker uses the synthetic data to guess information on records in the original data.\n",
    "- the \"control\" privacy attack, in which the attacker uses the synthetic data to guess information on records in the control dataset. \n",
    "- the \"baseline\" attack, which models a naive attacker who ignores the synthetic data and guess randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking how many of these guesses are correct, the success rates of the different attacks are measured and used to derive an estimate of the privacy risk. In particular, the \"control attack\" is used to separate what the attacker learns from the *utility* of the synthetic data, and what is instead indication of privacy leaks. The \"baseline attack\" instead functions as a sanity check. The \"main attack\" attack should outperform random guessing in order for the results to be trusted. "
